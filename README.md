# ReFresh Deals

## Application Description:
In food retail businesses, managing inventory and expiry dates is a significant challenge. Shop owners are often left with the choice of dealing with unsold products that are nearing their expiry, leading to unnecessary wastage. In addition, the waste disposal process (from stores to waste disposal plants, incineration of waste) further emits a significant amount of carbon dioxide. According to the National Environment Agency (NEA)1, in 2023, an estimated 755,000 tonnes of food waste were generated, representing about 11% of total waste generated in that year. Additionally, only about 18% of the 755,000 tonnes were recycled, proving that there is still a significant gap in waste management and resource recovery. 

For consumers, they are under pressure to make thrifty decisions and shop wisely as the cost of living continues to rise. Many consumers, especially those with tight budgets, are looking for ways to save money when purchasing products that are still safe to use. Based on a YouGov2 survey, nearly half of Singapore consumers (48%) utilise discount codes or coupons to save money, and 46% wait for promotions before purchasing desired products. Moreover, 45% have a tight budget, and 40% purchase alternative, cheaper brands to maintain their expenditure within limits.

Consumers may be unaware of discounted or near-expiry items in stores, which leads to missed opportunities for both savings and sustainability. The app aims to combat food wastage due to expiry using reminders and statistics. Shop owners may offer discounts on expiring products. These would be displayed to buyers on the app, informing and encouraging them to purchase these discounted items and reducing food waste.

## Target Audience:
Regular Buyers and Shop Owners

## Solution Justifications:
### Shop Owners
According to The Straits Times, Major supermarket chains like FairPrice have reported generating substantial amounts of food waste. For instance, FairPrice stores generated 2,940 tonnes of food waste in 2019.

Having an app that allows shop owners to keep track of items that are expiring can significantly reduce this amount. With reminders, shop owners can provide discounts on expiring products to incentivise customers to purchase them. This helps prevent food waste by allowing items that would expire to be cleared out more quickly.

### Frequent Buyers
The app can provide a marketplace where customers can view and purchase products that are close to expiry but still safe for consumption. They can enjoy discounts on these products, making it an attractive option for those who are looking to save money. This feature encourages responsible consumption and supports sustainability by minimising food waste.
